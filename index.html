            <p>This section serves as an introduction, explaining the scope of Amazon’s physical and digital infrastructure, and setting the stage for a deep dive into its socio-economic and environmental consequences.
            </p>

                    Foreshadows the threshold of community dissent
                </li>
                <li>
                    Amazon’s pre-emptive strategy to control dissent
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>Driving along route 28 from Chantilly to Sterling in Northern Virginia, you may not notice the cluster of gray buildings with blue ribbons of paint set back from the road, dotted with newly planted young trees. If you did, you might assume these are the office buildings of an unnamed defense contractor – a common employer of these parts. If you looked closer you might notice the strange lines of the building which don’t follow regular ceiling heights of an office, or the few cars in the parking lot, the lack of windows, the security cameras, and the black metal fence that curves into spikes pointing outward. These unnamed buildings are Amazon’s data centers and they look eerily similar to the warehouses you might find along I-95 in New Jersey, I-15 south of Chicago, I-45 south of Dallas, or the I-10 connecting Los Angeles with the Inland Empire.</p>

            <div class="articleImage">

                <h5 class="caption">(Author screenshot: Oct 8, 2024)
                </h5>
            </div>

            <p>Entering into the Prime Land map presents a picture of Amazon’s built structures – its data centers and warehouses – dotted across the United States in relation to the communities that surround these buildings. The workers and computers inside these buildings are the operational engine that work around the clock to ensure the constant flow of goods and data to uphold the promises of a digital society that’s always connected and awaiting your next clickable purchase.
            </p>

            <p>The map opens with a measure of social vulnerability in the census tracts where an Amazon structure is located. The larger the size of the bubble, the higher the social vulnerability faced by the community living in the same census tract, as measured by the U.S. census. Some areas look like a virus spreading in urban networks and along well-traveled highways. Other dots stand out as lone locations peppered across the middle of states – Rapid City, South Dakota; Abilene, Texas; Springfield, Missouri; Jerome, Idaho.
